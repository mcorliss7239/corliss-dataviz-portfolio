# Final Project III

# The Final Data story

# Changes made since Part II
After part II, I had two distinct dashboards, one for corn and one for soy. While the dashboards were great and provided a lot of information for diving into a specific crop, they didn't facilitate comparison well. In finalizing my story, I decided to present it as a pitch for one crop or the other. To complete this, I combined the soy and corn data and refocused some of my graphs to emphasize the comparison element. The original Yield and $/BU graphs were combined to make Revenue per Acre. I originally had Planted vs Harvested graphs, but I turned these into Percentage of Harvest Loss by plotting the percent difference instead of the actual values. I also decided to include the Export Value graph, which I had made in my work for Part II, but didn't put on the dashboards. To round out the concepts of weather and exports, I did more research. I got 2026 weather forecasts from NOAA and added export value forecasts from the USDA. From here, I was able to construct the flow of the story into three main arguing points: revenue, weather forecasts, and market conditions. 

## The Audience
The audience for my story is Wisconsin agricultural farmers. I originally wanted to be broader and include cattle farmers and those who hay, but I realized I was getting overloaded with data. This forced me to trim cattle and hay from the scope of the project. It made more sense to move forward with corn and soy, as these two crops are more closely tied together than hay or cattle.

# Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed diving into this topic. With more time, the reasoning for choosing between corn and soy could be expanded. I cut a lot of data, and there was still more that I didn't get to. Additionally, more interactive charts would have really supported the story better.
