# About me
Hi! My name is Morgan Corliss and I'm a second year graduate student in the Business Intelligence & Data Analytics program at Carnegie Mellon University.

# What I hope to learn
I chose to take Telling Stories with Data because I want to become a better communicator. I had a previous instructor who always talked about how good communicators bring value to data. In this class I want to learn visualization dos and don'ts, familiarize myself with different types of diagrams/charts, and come away with the confidence to choose the best visualization for the given data/information. Hard work behind the scenes can easily be "lost in translation" when communicated to someone outside the organization. I want to bridge the gap so important data maintains its value. 

Following graduation I plan to work for the Army as a Data Scientist.
