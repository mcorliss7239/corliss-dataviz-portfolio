# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand how users interpret the dashboard | What’s your initial impression?                  |
|      |  What do you think this could be used for?                |
|      |  Who do you think the intended audience is?                |
|Identify which metrics are important for decision-making      | If you were planning next season’s planting, what charts would you consult?                 |
|      | What charts feel most useful or insightful?                  |
|Evaluate usability, clarity, and visual effectiveness       | The dashboard currently displays data from the past ten years. Is this timeframe helpful for your needs, or would you prefer a different range?                 |
|      | Do you prefer line charts, bar charts, or other formats for specific metrics?                 |
|      | Would you like to see other metrics included?                 |
| Discover gaps in data presentation or user expectations     |Is there anything missing that you think would be helpful?                  |
|      | Is there anything else you’d like to share?                 |
