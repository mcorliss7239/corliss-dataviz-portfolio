# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience for my project is Wisconsin farmers, specifically those involved with the corn, soybean, and hay industries. I did not end up interviewing any Wisconsin farmers though as I don't personally know any. Instead, I interviewed two professionals and one MBA graduate student who has experience in Tableau. While they weren't familiar with the background of the farming industry they were able to give honest impressions of the interpretability of the visualizations and gave feedback from their own personal experience. 

## Interview script
For my interview I didn't provide any context to the interviewees. I wanted them to answer the questions solely based off their impressions of the corn dashboard I shared with them. I only presented my corn dashboard as the soy and hay dashboards are similiar in structure and information presented. I felt it would be redundant and time consuming to go through all three separate dashbaords. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand how users interpret the dashboard | What’s your initial impression?                  |
|      |  What do you think this could be used for?                |
|      |  Who do you think the intended audience is?                |
|Identify which metrics are important for decision-making      | If you were planning next season’s planting, what charts would you consult?                 |
|      | What charts feel most useful or insightful?                  |
|Evaluate usability, clarity, and visual effectiveness       | The dashboard currently displays data from the past ten years. Is this timeframe helpful for your needs, or would you prefer a different range?                 |
|      | Do you prefer line charts, bar charts, or other formats for specific metrics?                 |
|      | Would you like to see other metrics included?                 |
| Discover gaps in data presentation or user expectations     |Is there anything missing that you think would be helpful?                  |
|      | Is there anything else you’d like to share?                 |

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 (Civil Engineer) | Interview 2 (Army Officer) | Interview 3 (MBA Graduate Student)|
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What’s your initial impression?| This is good            | There is a lot of data about agricultural conditions             | Busy            |
| What do you think this could be used for?                        | Corn production values and tracking changes YTD    |    Tracking impact of gov. policy on agriculture          |    Understanding corn statistics in Wisconsin         |
| Who do you think the intended audience is?                          | Farmers, anyone invested in farming businesses or bulk purchasing of corn                                |  Gov. agencies that monitor agricultural data           | Farmers who grow corn     |
|  If you were planning next season’s planting, what charts would you consult?                          | Drought, rainfall, corn conditions                  | I would track rainfall conditions and corn yield             |   Corn yield and corn price          |
| What charts feel most useful or insightful?                           |  Corn stock                               |  Corn Export value           | Looking at the relationship between drought, rainfall, and corn conditions            |
|  The dashboard currently displays data from the past ten years. Is this timeframe helpful for your needs, or would you prefer a different range?                       |  25 years  | 10-20 years is helpful | Doing a five-year span would cut down on information overload|
| Do you prefer line charts, bar charts, or other formats for specific metrics?                          |I love line charts/ bar charts |Bar charts |I think the mix of different graph types is good|
|   Would you like to see other metrics included?                         |Labels|Some charts could use more detailed labels | Information on where corn exports are going. Maybe breaking down the data by county |
|  Is there anything missing that you think would be helpful?                        | Labels on corn condition (meanings)  |Labels on some of the x and y axis for a few of the graphs |Charts need more detailed axes, labels, and titles|
| Is there anything else you’d like to share?                         |N/A|   N/A  |  Outside context like policy changes and other big events might be a good add to explain why certain things are happening in the graphs   |

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Findings or observations from interviews | Describe what, if any changes you anticipate making to address the observation. |
| Interviewees (2/3) suggested covering a longer time period, 10 to 25 years |  I'll test this out with a range of 20 years on my dashboard. I agree with this point and originally I covered 25 years in my charts. My main concern is that it'll make my already crowded dashboard too crowded but I'll give it another try regardless                                                                            |
|  Interviewees seemed to find the two environmental charts (dought monitor and annual rainfall) helpful  |  I would like to expand my environmental section to really tie in the relationship between weather and conditions/yield. I think adding a chart on temperatures with average, high, and low would be well received         |
| Interviewees asked for more detail and labels. One of the interviewees misinterpreted the "Corn Stocks" chart as financial assets instead of supply | My charts are unpolished and need better titles, axis labels, and clear units. Without the necessary context I run the risk of my charts being misinterpreted like the "Corn Stocks" chart                                                                                |
| An interviewee mentioned adding "outside" context to explain highs and lows in the graphs    | I think this is a great idea. National policy and especially in the case of soybeans, international relations, can help explain trends in the data                                                                              |
